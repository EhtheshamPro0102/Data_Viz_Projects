**Project: Salary Insights of Data Professionals (Tableau Storytelling)**  

This is a **unique, self-driven project** where I downloaded the **IT Salary Survey dataset from Kaggle** and independently carried out the entire data preparation, cleaning, and analysis process using **Python (Pandas)** and **Excel**.  

I performed a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover meaningful insights on salary trends across factors such as **technology, experience, gender, company size**, and more. The results were then presented through **interactive visualizations in Tableau**, focusing on **data storytelling** to make the insights actionable and easy to interpret.  

The project showcases my ability to **clean raw data, perform detailed analysis, and communicate findings effectively using visualization tools like Tableau.**

The objective was to identify patterns and relationships within the data, providing valuable insights into salary distributions while 
showcasing my expertise in **data preparation, analysis, and visualization storytelling.**
